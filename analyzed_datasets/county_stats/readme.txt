There are two datasets here: county populations, and county
demographics.

County Population
- Processed version of the Population Colorado (county_population)
  data. The original data has nearly 400,000 rows because they give
  you separate stats for each individual age, so you have to do the
  aggregations yourself. I've aggregated into two age groups: minor
  (18 and under) and adult (19 and up).

Demographics
- The original data, Census Counties in Colorado 2019, (and the 2012
  version) have over 150 columns. There's a bunch of demographic data
  we don't need, so I've selected only the columns that might be
  relevant. Descriptions of each field are in the field_desc document.
